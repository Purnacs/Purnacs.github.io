Hi, This is Purna, a senior undergrad student studying Mathematics and Computer Science at IIT Delhi. I work on Deep Learning, Online Algorithms and Dynamical Systems. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Nisha Chandramoorthy](https://ni-sha-c.github.io/) from Georgia Tech on **Machine Learned KAF for uniformly hyperbolic systems** and [Prof. Rahul Vaze](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~vaze/) from TIFR on **Online Algorithms in limited information setting**. Apart from these, I am also passionate about Mathematics, Astronomy and Physics. I look forward to persuing PhD in future.

At leisure, I like to listen to Indian classical and Western music and watch movies. I also like to read books on History, Foreign Affairs and Mythology. Coming from Hyderabad, India - I am also a foodie. I have always liked to explore new places and have loved travelling.

Always up for a chat, use my social media handles or email to connect with me.
